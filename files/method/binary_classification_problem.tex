(In Progress)

The task presented in this work is part of a broader set of problems: binary classification.
The main idea is to classify instances in two disjoint groups such as positives and negatives,
corrects and incorrects, true or false.

In this case, the objective is determining if different utterances were correctly or incorrectly 
pronounced. As it was said before, the chosen unit of anaylsis is the phone.
