\subsection{McNemar's Test} \label{subsection:mcnemar}

\textit{McNemar's Test} \cite{mcnemar}
is used as an alternative to determine whether the \textit{SVM}
based on the combined features and the \textit{SVM} based only on features
derived from the \textit{GMM} adaptation are significantly different.

Given a set of $n$ test samples labeled by two systems, $A_{1}$ and $A_{2}$
the results can be summarized as:

\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{ | c | c | c | }
    \hline
    & Correctly Predicted by $A_{2}$ & Incorrectly Predicted by $A_{2}$ \\ \hline
    Correctly Predicted by $A_{1}$ & $N_{0,0}$ & $N_{0,1}$ \\ \hline
    Incorrectly Predicted by $A_{1}$ & $N_{1,0}$ & $N_{1,1}$ \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}

\begin{itemize}
\item{$N_{0, 0}$ is the number of samples which $A_{1}$ classifies correctly and $A_{2}$ classifies correctly}
\item{$N_{0, 1}$ is the number of samples which $A_{1}$ classifies correctly and $A_{2}$ classifies incorrectly}
\item{$N_{1, 0}$ is the number of samples which $A_{1}$ classifies incorrectly and $A_{2}$ classifies correctly}
\item{$N_{1, 1}$ is the number of samples which $A_{1}$ classifies incorrectly and $A_{2}$ classifies incorrectly}
\end{itemize}

Let $p_{1}$ be the error rate of the system $A_{1}$ and $p_{2}$ the error rate of the
system $A_{2}$. \\
Let $q_{0,0}$ be the probability of ($A_{1}$ correct $\land$ $A_{2}$ correct),
$q_{0,1}$ the probability \\ of ($A_{1}$ correct $\land$ $A_{2}$ incorrect), and so on. Hence:

\begin{multicols}{2}
  \noindent
  \begin{equation}
    % \label{eq:p1}
    p_{1} = q_{1,0} + q_{1,1}
  \end{equation}
  \begin{equation}
    % \label{eq:p2}
    p_{2} = q_{0,1} + q_{1,1}
  \end{equation}
\end{multicols}

The \textit{null hypothesis} $p1=p2$ is equivalent to $q_{1,0}=q_{0,1}$. Defining
$q=q_{1,0}/(q_{1,0}+q_{0,1})$ the \textit{null hypothesis} becomes $q=\frac{1}{2}$.
The probability $q$ is the probability that given that only one of the systems
made an error, it was system $A_{1}$ that did. Under the \textit{null hypothesis},
$N_{1,0}$ is distributed as a Binomial Distribution $B(n,1/2)$, where $n$ is
the observed number of samples for which only one system made an error: $N_{1,0}+N_{0,1}$.
At this point, a two-tail test can be applied to obtain a \textit{p-value}.

In conclusion \textit{McNemar's Test} is based on cross information by comparing the results of
evaluating both systems on exactly the same sample. \textit{Bootstrapping} differs on this
point because each sample is evaluated independently for each system.
An advantage for Bootstrapping over McNemar's, however,
is that the latter assumes that the samples are
independent, and that condition does not hold in the current work.

A complementary analysis using both different techniques is explored in this work
in order to determine the statistic significance of the results.
