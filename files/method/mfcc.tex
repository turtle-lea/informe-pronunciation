Two family of features were chosen for our experiments: \textit{Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients}
(MFCC, Davis and Mermelstein 1980) and \textit{Perceptual Linear Predictive} 
(PLP, Hermansky 1990). Both kind of features are standards in audio signal processing.

Original audio is divided into frames 

Perceptual Linear Predictive consists of \ldots
