The first step in order to build the system is to extract features from the speech data.
The feature extraction process aims at approximating the linguistic content that is conveyed
by the speech signal, by identifying its relevant aspects and discarding other unuseful
properties like background noise, emotions, etc.

\subsection{MFCCs Extraction}
In this work we base our features in the standard and widely used Mel Frecuency
Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs). They were introduced by Davis and Mermelstein in 1980 and
have been state-of-the-art ever since \cite{mfcc_foundational}.
MFCC coefficients represent the spectral envelope of the speech signal on the Mel-frequency scale,
which relates the perceived frequency of a pure tune to its actual measured frequency inspired
by the human hearing.

The process to compute the MFCCs coefficients can be summarized into applying the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}

  \item Preemphasis: Preemphasis aims at increasing the amplitude of high frequency bands while
  decreasing the amplitudes of lower bands by means of a high-pass filter. This stage is performed
  in order to balance the frequency spectrum since high frequencies usually have smaller
  magnitudes compared to lower ones.

  \item Windowing: The MFCCs are computed in time intervals where the audio signal isn't
  supposed to be changing
  so much. Because of that reason the signal is divided in frames using a
  25 ms duration window and 10 ms shift (standard values). A 25 ms duration window provides
  enough samples to get a reliable spectral estimate: 200 samples per frame at 8 $kHz$,
  and at the same time is short enough to minimize the signal changes.
  On the other hand, a 10 ms shift leads to a
  15 ms overlap between consecutive frames, ensuring that the information between adjacent
  frames is also captured in the middle of another frame.

  \item Discrete Fourier Transform: This is the first and main step in regard to spectral
  analysis. Frequency domain approaches are proven to be
  among the best options in speech classification tasks.
  The \textit{spectral density}, which is the distribution of power
  into the frequency components composign the signal, is obtained for each frame by using
  the Discrete Fourier Transform technique.   % mfcc_extraction_v3

  \item Mel Filter-bank: At this stage, a perceptual scale of pitches inspired in human
  hearing called Mel scale is used. Because humans are much better at discerning small changes
  in pitch at low frequencies than they are at high frequencies,
  the Mel frequency scale is linear up to 1000Hz and logarithmic thereafter according to
  the following formula:

  \begin{equation}
    M(f)=1125*ln(1 + \frac{f}{700})
  \end{equation}

  The spectrum obtained in (3) is passed through a series of traingular filters
  uniformly spaced on the Mel scale to produce the so called filter-bank energies.
  The original values of these energies are replaced by their natural logarithm values,
  also motivated by human hearing: loudness is not perceived according to
  a linear but an exponential scale.

  \item Cepstral Coefficients: The Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) is applied to the logarithm
  of the filterbank energies to obtain the Cepstral Coefficients. In general, only the lower
  12 Cepstral Coefficients are kept. The resulting features are called Mel Frequency
  Cepstral Coefficients. Additionally, a $13\textsuperscript{th}$ MFCC computed
  as the sum of the energy in the frame is included,
  because it usually improves the performance in phone detection
  related tasks.

  \item Deltas and Double Deltas: Finally, the speech also carries information
  in the dynamics, i.e, trajectories of the MFCC coefficients over time. Calculating
  the MFCC trajectories and appending them to the original MFCC vector usually increase the
  performance of the systems. Both Delta and Delta-Delta features are included, adding to
  a total of 39 features per frame.
