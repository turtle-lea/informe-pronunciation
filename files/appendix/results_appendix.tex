In this section we include two plots that summarizes the results obtained when validating the final models in both development and hold-out set.

	\caption{Comparison of relative gains over the Baseline Systems
	between Features Combination systems and Score Combination systems
	computed on the development set for all the phones.
	Results are sorted \textcolor{red}{in descending order according to their}
	McNemar p-values computed on the development set.
	Only the results marked with (*) gave statistically significant gains in the development set.}
