Computer-Assisted language learning systems have been evolving for the last few years due to
technological advances. An important subset of these tools are those which focus in
automatic pronunciation scoring and pronunciation assesment. Particularly, we
are interested in systems that provide phone-level feedback on pronunciation quality,
because they not only can point out specific errors to the students but they also
can be used by children that are still unable to pronounce whole sentences or paragraphs.

In a previous work in the pronunciation assessment field at phone level, a discriminative
approach based on \textit{Support Vector Machines} (SVM) trained on special features
called \textit{supervectors} was explored, leading to slightly better results than
generative models such as \textit{Gaussian Mixture Models} (GMMs), which are usually
used in the pronunciation assessment field. Supervectors are derived from
adapted GMMs that are trained using all the available instances for a given phone.

In this work we use SVM models to explore dynamic features that model
temporal dependencies in each instance. Two different techiniques are studied:
\textit{Legendre Polynomials} and \textit{Discrete Cosine Transform} (DCT).
The objective is to analyse if both supervectors and dynamic features carry
complementary information, which can be used to improve future models. In order to do
so, two alternatives are proposed: A Features Combination, where a single classifier
is trained on the combination of both supervectors and dynamic features, and a
Score Combination, which is obtained by combining the scores of two SVM classifiers
trained independently on each set of features.

The dataset for the current work is obtained from a Latin-American Spanish speech database,
and consists in 2550 utterances adding up to a total of 130,000 phone instances, labeled
by expert phoneticians. Recordings are uttered by 206 native American English speakers.
Results showed that for a subset of the phones, the combination of supervectors and
dynamic features reduce the error compared with using supervectors only, thus supporting
the hypothesis that both set of features carry complementary information. Both feature-level
and score-level combinations gave similar results, and therefore it is not possible
to pick one type of combination as the best.
